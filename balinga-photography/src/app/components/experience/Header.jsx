      <p>
        Life is made up of fleeting moments — a soft glance, a genuine laugh,
        the quiet in-between. I don’t just take photos; I tell stories. Wherever
        you are in the world, whatever chapter you're in, I’m here to capture it
        with heart. Through my lens, I seek the beauty in the honest, the raw,
        and the deeply human. Let’s create something timeless together.
